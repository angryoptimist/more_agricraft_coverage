What is this?
=============

This is a set of configuration files for AgriCraft.

## ...Care to expand on that?

To be specific, it's a set of configuration files for pasting over top of an existing AgriCraft configuration.  What this *intends* to add is support for Actually Additions (Flax, Canola, Coffee, & Rice), Natura (Barley & Cotton), Immersive Engineering (Hemp), various vanilla flowers previously handled by AgriCraft (such as poppies, daisies, and the various tulips), and a general realignment of mutations for Pam's HarvestCraft, Botania's Mystical Flowers, and vanilla crop cross-breeding closer to how it was in AgriCraft in 1.7.10.  With just wheat and beet seeds, it *should* (if I didn't mess anything up) be possible to breed all vanilla crops, HarvestCraft crops, and mystical flowers--Natura stuff/Actually Additions stuff/Hemp will require that you find seeds the old-fashioned way.  And I added a file to support the Ender Lilly from Extra Utilities 2 as a crop--but I can imagine the screaming about 'game balance' (plus, the progress texture for it went a little wacky in the Agricultural Journal), so I left it disabled.

Oh, and I made the 'friendly name' for the podzol soil "Podzol" instead of "podzol", to match the case of the others.  That was bugging me.

I've tested it with FTB Beyond.  And by "tested", I mean I haven't really tested them *at all* and that was just my target I was writing them against and trying them out on.  No warranty, express or implied, if these melt your computer it's your own damn fault, etc.  Anyway, they seem to be working for me.

*If* you're willing to risk it, though, I release this in the hope that it is useful.  Just paste the contents of this repository (minus this file and the LICENSE file--though I don't *think* it's likely to harm anything if you paste those too) into config/agricraft/ in the Minecraft directory of the FTB Beyond instance you're playing with.

Incidentally, AgriCraft for 1.10.2 touts the feature of automatically replicating server configuration to clients (which they then use when connecting to that server).  And these configuration files use only the textures already in-place in AgriCraft/Natura/Immersive Engineering/Actually Additions.  It's completely untested, but these *might* work on a server...

## But why?

Because I like AgriCraft and it annoyed me that I couldn't get sugarcane seeds.  It all kinda snowballed from there...

Also, from what I saw, nobody else had done it yet--even though it was relatively straightforward to do.  Hopefully, I've save someone, somewhere an hour or two of tedious data entry (you're welcome).

## What you can do with this

I CC0'd what I've done here; it's a permissive content license (JSON isn't code--it's content) that's easy to comply with.  As I understand it, it is a document that specifically and carefully grants you the rights to do virtually anything with a work it is applied to.  Why do we need such a document for (basically) telling people they can do whatever they want with a given work?  Because IP law is a fevered Lovecraftian nightmare.
